All prospective members are welcome to have up to two "taster" sessions before committing to joining the club. New members will need to become social members of the Holyhead Sailing Club (£60 a year) as well as joining the rowing club which costs £20 per year. This fee is to cover membership of Welsh Sea Rowing and includes personal insurance. Existing members of the sailing club only need to join the rowing club.

To have either a taster row or to join, please fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6uWSjHYmK6nv0aIPdKx-RXpDN-R-7Iy33QusrgKHnicPHrg/viewform">this Google form</a>. We will then contact you with more information and send you a link to join a "Spond" group which is how sessions are organised.

Information on what to wear for rowing is on <a href="/clothing/">this</a> page

Once a member, we charge £2 every time they go rowing by quarterly direct debit through GoCardless
