All prospective members are welcome to have up to two "taster" sessions before committing to joining the club. Annual membership is £80 and members will become "associate" members of the Holyhead Sailing Club as well as joining the rowing club. This fee covers "associate" membership of the Holyhead Sailing Club plus membership of Welsh Sea Rowing and includes [personal insurance for rowing](https://www.searowing.wales/insurance/). 

To have either a taster row or to join, please fill in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf6uWSjHYmK6nv0aIPdKx-RXpDN-R-7Iy33QusrgKHnicPHrg/viewform">this Google form</a>. We will then contact you with more information and send you a link to join a "Spond" group which is how sessions are organised.

Information on what to wear for rowing is on <a href="/clothing/">this</a> page

Once a member, we charge £2 every time a member goes rowing and collect this by quarterly direct debit through GoCardless.
