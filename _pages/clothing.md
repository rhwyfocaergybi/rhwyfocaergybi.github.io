<h3>Suitable clothing</h3>
<p>We row all year round, so selecting the right gear for each season is essential to ensure you stay comfortable in training sessions.
What clothing fabric type is right for you? Wicking versus breathable.
Wicking fabrics are generally light, fast drying and breathable. These fabrics contain microdot holes which draw the sweat away from the skin and through fabric layer which evaporates the water, drying the clothing quickly. this mimics the capillary cell action.
Wicking fabrics include Lycra, Polyester, Nylon, Polypropylene, Micromodal, Merino wool and Wool.
Wicking clothing is generally more expensive than some breathable fabrics, but the benefits outweigh the cost as they keep you dry/cool in the heat and warmer in the winter months.</p>

<p>Breathable fabrics include the above with the addition of cotton, Linen, and chambray.
These fabrics also contain holes that allows air to pass through, but it takes much longer for moisture to evaporate as they lack the wicking effect. If you tend to sweat excessively when exercising, these fabrics will hold on to water, therefore can make you feel wet and very cold quickly, especially in the cooler Autum and Winter months.</p>

<p>For sculling you will need to make sure your clothing is relatively close fitting, but not restrictive.
Lycra shorts/leggings and T-shirts are optimal as they are good wicking fabrics, light and breathable. Ensure tops are not too long, hip height is optimal anything longer can catch in the sliding seat runners, similar if you have any excess material on your shorts/trousers.</p>

<p>Long hair should be tied up not loose, this could be a potential hazard if you capsize. There has been recent fatality where a woman’s hair has been caught in the runners of the seat and sadly, she drowned.</p>

<h3>Summer recommendations</h3>
<ul><li>Sunscreen</li>
<li>UV protective sun glasses</li>
<li>Base ball hat, Bandana, buff</li>
<li>Shorts/leggings</li>
<li>Vest/t-shirt</li>
<li>Optional carry a light long sleeve top for sun protection on longer rows/ and/or if the weather changes to keep you warm</li>
<li>Windstopper Jacket for breezy days</li>
<li>Waterproof shell jacket for rainy days</li>
<li>Wet shoes/sandles/boots</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spring/Autum/winter recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The weather can be interchangeable, be prepared and have a mixture of thin layers, short and long sleeve tops. Layers can be removed during training once you have warmed up during exercising, also when you start to get cold, they can be layered back up to keep you warm. Hypothermia is a real risk in winter especially when there’s ground frost/ snow/ icy winds and rain.</li>
<li>Base layers (wicks sweat from the body).</li>
<li>Mid layer jumper (insulating layer retains heat).</li>
<li>Body warmer Gillet warn with long/short sleeve top, is good to keep your core warm and can be less restrictive.</li>
<li>Shorts/leggings/tracksuit trousers</li>
<li>Waterproof trousers/ hard shell waterproof coat (outer layer protects you from the elements wind/rain/snow, stay dry).</li>
<li>UV protective sunglasses.</li>
<li>Woolly hat, buff, bandana.</li>
<li>Gloves are essential for coxing, but they can be tricky to wear in sculling as its difficult to get a good hold on the handle blades.</li>
<li>Wet boots.</li>
</ul>
