Rowing isn't especially complicated, particularly in as stable a boat as a Celtic Longboat, however paying attention to technique will help to prevent injury. We will help you with this, but the principles are:
<ul>
<li>Sit comfortably with knees bent to about 45 degrees</li>
<li>Hold the handle loosely in the fingers</li>
<li>Reach only as far as your feet. Do not twist the back to reach any further forward</li>
<li>Drop the oar into the water. Let it find it's own depth</li>
<li>Initiate the drive by bracing with the feet & pushing with your legs</li>
<li>Lean back, pushing with the legs, trying to keep your arms as straight as possible</li>
<li>When you're laying back to about 30 degrees, allow your arms to come to the top of your chest</li>
<li>Tap the oar out of the water, then push your arms out</li>
<li>Sit back up then reach forward to the "catch" position</li>
<li>Repeat!</li>
</ul>

Important points:
<ol>
<li>Don't over-reach forwards</li>
<li>Don't lean too far back either!</li>
<li>Keep in time with the stroke</li>
<li>Get the timing right before putting on the beans!</li>
</ol>
