This is an exciting time for Caergybi/Holyhead! We're forming a new rowing club in what is potentially one of the best venues in the UK for coastal rowing.

<p>Holyhead has a rich maritime tradition and rowing races took place regularly between the crews of the mail boats! We want to re-establish this amazing sport and share it with anyone from the local area who'd like to have a go. Contact us for more details.</p>
