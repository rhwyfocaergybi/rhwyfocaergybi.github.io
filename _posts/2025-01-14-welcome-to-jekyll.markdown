<p>Things are currently in their very early stages. We've been in touch with some interested parties in Holyhead, but we'd welcome hearing from you if you have any interest in helping us set the club up.</p>
<p>We're looking for a secure location to keep a boat and store oars and life-jackets. If you have any suggestions or if you have a place you'd be willing for us to use, please let us know by email at rwyfocaergybi@gmail.com</p>
